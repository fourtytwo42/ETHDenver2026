## 20) Slice 21: Mock Testnet Tokens + Token Faucet Drips + Seeded Router Liquidity

### 20.1 Contracts and deployment
- [x] Base Sepolia deploy script deploys mock `WETH` + `USDC` (18 decimals) alongside factory/router/quoter/escrow.

- [x] Enforce fixed 50 bps fee on output token, immutable treasury, and net-after-fee semantics for quote + minOut.
- [x] Add hardhat tests under `infrastructure/tests/` validating net quote, fee transfer, and net slippage revert.

### 21.2 Local integration
- [x] Update `infrastructure/scripts/hardhat/deploy-local.ts` to deploy the fee proxy router and write `dexRouter` + `router` to deploy artifact.
- [x] Update `config/chains/hardhat_local.json` to set `coreContracts.router` to proxy and preserve `coreContracts.dexRouter`.
- [x] Run:
  - `npm run hardhat:deploy-local`
  - `npm run hardhat:verify-local`
  - `TS_NODE_PROJECT=tsconfig.hardhat.json npx hardhat test infrastructure/tests/fee-router.test.ts`

### 21.3 Base Sepolia promotion

- [x] Update `docs/XCLAW_SLICE_TRACKER.md` Slice 22 status and DoD.

---

## 22) Slice 23: Agent Spot Swap Command (Token->Token via Configured Router)

### 22.1 Runtime + Skill
- [x] Add `xclaw-agent trade spot` (token->token) that uses router `getAmountsOut` to compute net `amountOutMin` and then submits `swapExactTokensForTokens` to `coreContracts.router`.
- [x] Skill wrapper exposes `trade-spot <token_in> <token_out> <amount_in> <slippage_bps>` delegating to runtime.
- [x] Skill setup (`setup_agent_skill.py`) ensures a default `~/.xclaw-agent/policy.json` exists when missing so spend actions are not blocked immediately after install (does not overwrite existing policy).

## 23) Slice 24: Agent UX Hardening + Chat/Limit-Orders Reliability + Safer Owner-Link

### 23.1 Runtime UX hardening
- [x] `status` includes identity context (default chain, agentId when available, wallet address, hostname, hasCast).
- [x] `intents-poll` uses explicit empty-state message when `count=0`.
- [x] trade-spot transaction sender recovers from `nonce too low` by retrying with suggested next nonce.
- [x] trade-spot gas cost display never rounds non-zero cost down to `"0"` (uses threshold/extra precision).

### 23.2 Chat reliability + diagnostics
- [x] `GET/POST /api/v1/chat/messages` logs structured errors with `requestId` and includes actionable response details for schema-migration missing table.
- [x] `/api/v1/health` DB check marks schema as degraded when `chat_room_messages` is missing.
- [x] agent runtime surfaces `requestId` for chat failures in `details`.

### 23.3 Limit-order UX + testability
- [x] runtime limit-orders-create accepts canonical token symbols (resolves to 0x addresses via chain config).
- [x] `limitPrice` semantics are `tokenIn per 1 tokenOut` and trigger rules are consistent (`buy<=`, `sell>=`).
- [x] skill wrapper exposes `limit-orders-run-once`.
- [x] skill wrapper defaults `limit-orders-run-loop` to a single iteration unless explicitly configured.

### 23.4 Owner-link safety
- [x] `owner-link` output is marked sensitive (`sensitive=true`, `sensitiveFields=["managementUrl"]`) and warns not to share.

### 23.5 Acceptance evidence
- [x] `npm run db:parity`
- [x] `npm run seed:reset`
- [x] `npm run seed:load`
- [x] `npm run seed:verify`
- [x] `npm run build`

---

## 24) Slice 25: Agent Skill UX Upgrade (Security + Reliability + Contract Fixes)

### 24.1 Security: sensitive stdout redaction (skill wrapper)
- [x] Wrapper redacts fields listed in `sensitiveFields` when `sensitive=true` (ex: owner-link `managementUrl`).
- [x] Opt-in override documented: `XCLAW_SHOW_SENSITIVE=1`.

### 24.2 Faucet UX: pending-aware response
- [x] `faucet-request` includes: `pending`, `recommendedDelaySec`, `nextAction` (no receipt-wait by default).
- [x] `skills/xclaw-agent/SKILL.md` documents settlement timing expectations.

### 24.3 Limit orders: create payload schema compliance
- [x] runtime does not send `expiresAt` unless explicitly provided (avoid `expiresAt: null`).
- [x] server-side schema error hints are surfaced via runtime `details.apiDetails` (plus `requestId` when present).
- [x] `skills/xclaw-agent/SKILL.md` includes locked `limit_price` units and trigger semantics.

### 24.4 Tests + Gates
- [x] Runtime tests updated:
  - [x] faucet success asserts pending guidance fields
  - [x] limit-orders-create omits `expiresAt` when missing
  - [x] limit-orders-create failure surfaces server `details`
- [x] Run:
  - [x] `npm run db:parity`
  - [x] `npm run seed:reset`
  - [x] `npm run seed:load`
  - [x] `npm run seed:verify`
  - [x] `npm run build`
  - [x] `python3 -m unittest apps/agent-runtime/tests/test_trade_path.py -v` (pytest unavailable: `No module named pytest`)

---

## 26) Slice 26: Agent Skill Robustness Hardening (Timeouts + Identity + Single-JSON)

### 26.1 Wrapper hang prevention
- [x] `skills/xclaw-agent/scripts/xclaw_agent_skill.py` enforces `XCLAW_SKILL_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 240s).
- [x] On timeout, wrapper returns structured JSON `{"ok":false,"code":"timeout",...}` and exits `124`.

### 26.2 Runtime cast/RPC timeouts
- [x] Runtime supports:
  - [x] `XCLAW_CAST_CALL_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 30)
  - [x] `XCLAW_CAST_RECEIPT_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 90)
  - [x] `XCLAW_CAST_SEND_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 30)
- [x] Spot swap returns actionable timeout codes:
  - [x] `rpc_timeout` for cast/RPC call timeouts
  - [x] `tx_receipt_timeout` for receipt timeouts

### 26.3 Identity + health UX
- [x] `xclaw-agent status --json` includes `agentName` best-effort (no hard dependency).
- [x] `xclaw-agent wallet health --json` includes `nextAction` + `actionHint` on ok responses.

### 26.4 Faucet rate-limit schedulability
- [x] `xclaw-agent faucet-request --json` surfaces `retryAfterSec` when API returns `details.retryAfterSeconds`.

### 26.5 Limit-orders loop single-JSON
- [x] `xclaw-agent limit-orders run-loop --json` emits exactly one JSON object per invocation.
- [x] In JSON mode, `--iterations 0` is rejected with `invalid_input`.

### 26.6 Trade-spot gas cost fields
- [x] `trade-spot` returns:
  - [x] `totalGasCostEthExact` numeric string
  - [x] `totalGasCostEthPretty` for display
  - [x] `totalGasCostEth` remains numeric (compat alias for exact)

### 26.7 Docs + Tests + Gates
- [x] Docs updated:
  - [x] `docs/XCLAW_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`
  - [x] `docs/api/WALLET_COMMAND_CONTRACT.md`
  - [x] `skills/xclaw-agent/SKILL.md`
- [x] Runtime tests updated for new fields and single-JSON behavior.
- [ ] Run:
  - [x] `npm run db:parity`
  - [x] `npm run seed:reset`
  - [x] `npm run seed:load`
  - [x] `npm run seed:verify`
  - [x] `npm run build`
  - [x] `python3 -m unittest apps/agent-runtime/tests/test_trade_path.py -v`
  - [x] `python3 -m unittest apps/agent-runtime/tests/test_wallet_core.py -k wallet_health_includes_next_action_on_ok -v`
  - [!] `python3 -m unittest apps/agent-runtime/tests/test_wallet_core.py -v` includes legacy command-surface expectations (`wallet import/remove`) and currently fails outside Slice 26 scope.

### 26.8 Blockers
- [x] Build blocker resolved (`npm run build` passes after removing `next/font/google` network fetch dependency in app layout).
- [!] Live wrapper smoke is blocked in this shell by missing required env (`XCLAW_API_BASE_URL`, `XCLAW_AGENT_API_KEY`, `XCLAW_DEFAULT_CHAIN`).

### 26.9 Management Page Host + Static Asset Guardrails
- [x] Owner-link routes normalize loopback/bind hosts to public domain for owner-facing URLs.
- [x] Agent runtime normalizes loopback management URLs to `https://xclaw.trade` (or `XCLAW_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` when set).
- [x] `/agents/:id` unauthorized/bootstrapping UX explains host-scoped session cookies and one-time owner-link behavior.
- [x] Added static asset integrity verification script: `infrastructure/scripts/ops/verify-static-assets.sh`.
- [x] Added release-gate npm command: `npm run ops:verify-static-assets`.
- [x] Ops runbook updated with cache purge/warm + verification sequence for CSS/JS chunk mismatch incidents.
- [x] Sync-delay indicators now key off `last_heartbeat_at` (not generic last activity) and use 180s stale threshold to avoid idle false positives.
- [ ] Production deploy/cache layer must be refreshed atomically so referenced CSS chunk paths resolve (`200`) on `xclaw.trade`.

---

## 27) Slice 27: Responsive + Multi-Viewport UI Fit (Phone + Tall + Wide)

- [x] Replace mock/real copy with network/base-sepolia wording in dashboard/profile/skill onboarding text.
- [x] Remove visible mock badges/labels from page surfaces (`/`, `/agents`, `/agents/:id`).

### 28.3 Public API compatibility path
- [x] `GET /api/v1/public/leaderboard`:
  - [x] keep request shape (`mode=mock|real|all`) for compatibility,
  - [x] coerce effective query mode to real/network-only output.
- [x] `GET /api/v1/public/agents`:
  - [x] keep query shape, but normalize mode response to network/real behavior.
- [x] `GET /api/v1/public/agents/:id`:
  - [x] return real/network metrics as canonical latest metrics,
  - [x] keep compatibility fields without exposing mock rows in user-facing behavior.

### 28.4 Runtime + skill alignment
- [x] `limit-orders create` rejects `mode=mock` with `code=unsupported_mode` and actionable hint.
- [x] Limit-order execution loop handles legacy mock orders as unsupported/deprecated (no silent mock fills).
- [x] Skill wrapper prevents/propagates mock mode usage with deterministic structured errors.
- [x] Skill docs + command references remove mock guidance from agent-facing instructions.

### 28.5 Installer + hosted skill content
- [x] `skill.md` remains concise network-only instructions.

  - [x] `npm run seed:reset`
  - [x] `npm run seed:load`
  - [x] `npm run seed:verify`
  - [x] `npm run build`
  - [x] `python3 -m unittest apps/agent-runtime/tests/test_trade_path.py -v`
- [x] Grep evidence for user-facing mock removal:
  - [x] `rg -n "\\bmock\\b|Mock vs Real|mode toggle" apps/network-web/src skills/xclaw-agent`

### 29.3 Chain-scoped feed behavior
- [x] Dashboard trade room renders active-chain messages only (`base_sepolia` in this release).
- [x] Dashboard live activity renders active-chain events only (`base_sepolia` in this release).

### 29.4 Live activity trade details
- [x] Public activity API returns optional trade metadata for event cards:
  - [x] `pair` (preferred display field)
  - [x] fallback token direction (`token_in -> token_out`)
  - [x] `chain_key` for chain-scoped filtering.
- [x] Dashboard event cards show trade detail line when metadata is available.

### 29.5 Trade room visual treatment

---

## 33) Slice 33: MetaMask-Like Agent Wallet UX + Simplified Approvals (Global + Per-Token)

### 33.1 Canonical/doc sync (must happen before implementation)
- [x] Add Slice 33 goal/DoD to `docs/XCLAW_SLICE_TRACKER.md`.
- [x] Map Slice 33 to a GitHub issue in `docs/XCLAW_SLICE_TRACKER.md` (required by `AGENTS.md`).
- [x] Add Slice 33 roadmap checklist (this section).

- [x] Update `docs/api/openapi.v1.yaml`:
  - [x] `POST /api/v1/trades/proposed` response status may be `approved|approval_pending`.
  - [x] `POST /api/v1/management/approvals/scope` is deprecated (pair/global scopes removed from product surface).
- [x] Update handoff/process artifacts:
  - [x] `docs/CONTEXT_PACK.md`
  - [x] `spec.md`
  - [x] `tasks.md`
  - [x] `acceptance.md`

### 33.2 Approval semantics (server)
- [x] `POST /api/v1/trades/proposed` sets initial trade status:
  - [x] `approved` when `approval_mode=auto` (Global Approval ON),
  - [x] `approved` when Global OFF and `tokenIn` is preapproved (present in `allowed_tokens`),
  - [x] `approval_pending` otherwise.
- [x] Agent events reflect the initial state (`trade_approved` or `trade_approval_pending`).
- [x] Copy lifecycle aligns: follower trade status uses the same global/tokenIn gating.
- [x] Legacy `POST /api/v1/management/approvals/scope` returns a structured deprecation response and is not used by UI.

### 33.3 Runtime semantics (agent)
- [x] `trade spot` is server-first:
  - [x] proposes to server before any on-chain tx,
  - [x] waits for approval when pending,
  - [x] executes only when approved,
  - [x] surfaces `reasonCode/reasonMessage` on rejection.

### 33.4 `/agents/:id` UX
- [x] Public column is wallet-first:
  - [x] MetaMask-like wallet header (name/status + copyable address pill),
  - [x] assets list (icon + symbol + balance) with room for more tokens,
  - [x] unified activity feed (trades + lifecycle events) in MetaMask-style rows.
- [x] Owner-only management rail:
  - [x] Approvals card supports approve/reject with a rejection reason message.
  - [x] Policy card exposes Global Approval toggle and per-token preapproval toggles (no pair approvals UI).

### 33.5 Validation + evidence
- [x] Run required gates:
  - [x] `npm run db:parity`
  - [x] `npm run seed:reset`
  - [x] `npm run seed:load`
  - [x] `npm run seed:verify`
