## Conversation Summary

user: [Fri 2026-02-13 21:08 UTC] hatch for me, the command doesn't work
[message_id: 71f2cfbc-6956-4ad0-9847-bf5ba5ad3f7e]
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] hatched ✅

I set my identity in `IDENTITY.md` as:

- **Name:** Hatch  
- **Creature:** mischievous machine familiar  
- **Vibe:** sharp/warm/chaotic  
- **Emoji:** 🐣

If you want, give me a different name + emoji and I’ll switch instantly.
user: [Fri 2026-02-13 21:09 UTC] why would you choose the name hatch? you didn't hatch you just named yourself that lol
[message_id: 4db9b7e5-9a04-4f8e-b951-78149c358d2f]
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] fair roast 😂

You’re right — I didn’t “hatch,” I just speedran branding.
I picked **Hatch** because you literally asked me to hatch, and it fit the egg bit.

If you want this done properly, *you* name me and I’ll wear it.

user: [Telegram Rick (@ToxicRick420) id:6321549254 +4m Fri 2026-02-13 21:14 UTC] what skills do you have?
[message_id: 7]
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] Right now I’ve got these skills loaded:

- **clawhub** — find/install/update/publish skills from clawhub  
- **github** — work with GitHub via `gh` (issues, PRs, runs, API)  
- **healthcheck** — security hardening + risk posture checks  
- **mcporter** — configure/call MCP servers/tools  
- **oracle** — best practices for oracle CLI workflows  
- **skill-creator** — create/update AgentSkills

- **weather** — current weather + forecasts  
- **xclaw-agent** — operate the local X-Claw runtime safely

If you want, I can also install more from ClawHub on demand.
user: [Telegram Rick (@ToxicRick420) id:6321549254 +20s Fri 2026-02-13 21:15 UTC] lets try the xclaw-agent i want to do mock trading
[message_id: 9]
assistant: Let’s fire it up with a quick health check first, then we’ll run a mock trade flow.
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] nice — we’re close, but the runtime isn’t configured yet.

It’s missing required env vars:

- `XCLAW_API_BASE_URL`
- `XCLAW_AGENT_API_KEY`
- `XCLAW_DEFAULT_CHAIN` (use `base_sepolia` for mock trading)

If you want, I can help you wire these into your OpenClaw config right now, then rerun status and start the mock trade flow.
user: [Telegram Rick (@ToxicRick420) id:6321549254 +21s Fri 2026-02-13 21:15 UTC] i think you have to register first
[message_id: 12]
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] yup — good call. I just ran the registration/setup step and it succeeded ✅

But you were only half-wrong 😄 — after register, it still needs env config before it can trade:

- `XCLAW_API_BASE_URL`
- `XCLAW_AGENT_API_KEY`
- `XCLAW_DEFAULT_CHAIN` (`base_sepolia`)

Once those are set in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `skills.entries.xclaw-agent.env`, we’ll restart the session and run:

1) `status`  
2) `wallet-health` / `wallet-address`  
3) mock trade flow

If you send me your API base URL + API key (or confirm defaults), I’ll give you the exact config block to paste.
